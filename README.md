## Code Formatting
1.  HTML
    *   Indent all child elements in by 1 tab or four spaces.
    *   Declare document type on the first line of every file
        using the following syntax:
        
            <!DOCTYPE html>
        
    *   Use lowercase element names in all tags.
    *   Close all html elements.
    *   Close the following elements on the same line:
        *   `<h1></h1>`, `<h2></h2>`, etc.
        *   `<strong></strong>`, `<em></em>`, etc.
        *   All head elements (eg. `<title></title>`, `<link/>`, etc.)
    *   Close all empty HTML tags with a `/`.
    *   All images should contain an `alt` attribute.
    *   Specify text encoding in the head.

2.  CSS
    *   Start all CSS files with the following syntax:

            /* =========[ CSS ]========= */
    
    *   The CCS file should contain three sections. Start all
        sections with the following syntax:

            /* ---------[ Section Name ]--------- */

    *   List the styling of elements in the first section, the
        styling of classes in the second, and the styling of ids
        in the third.
    *   Each section should be sorted alphabetically.
    *   List spacing attributes first, then size, then styling,
        and finally other attributes.
    *   Add one blank new line after each block.
