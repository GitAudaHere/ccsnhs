            <div class="answer">
                A. Each year, the NHS selects sophomore, junior, and senior students who display exemplary signs of scholarship,
                have been in attendance at Collegium for at least one semester, and have a cumulated weighted GPA of at least 93%,
                then you are eligible for further consideration based on your character, leadership, and service. You will be asked
                to fill out a "candidate information form" listing your leadership roles and service activities, and your teachers
                will be interviewed to determine your character. If the faculty council decides that you meet the selection criteria,
                then you get an invitation to our induction on November 14th, 2018, where we welcome you into our society!

            <div class="answer">
                A. If you find it difficult to attend the morning meetings, please come talk to one of the officers or a fellow member.
                You can find a full list of members in the "Our Members" page, and contact one of the officers in the "Contact" page.
                We'd be happy to help find someone to take you to our morning meetings. Fortunately, the meetings start at 7:10am this
                year, a little later than the 7:00am start time that we had last year, and there are fewer meetings, so you won't need
                to come as early or as often.

            <div class="answer">
                A. You can get hours for attending any NHS service event that occurs before or after school hours. You can find a list
                of events <a class="link" href="events">here.</a> All hours should be logged through <a class="link" href="hours">x2VOL</a>. Baking does not count towards
                NHS hours. Attending induction doesn't either; it's a mandatory event.

            <div class="answer">
                A. The goal of the Indepedent Service Project is to foster love and desire to serve the community in ways that you
                are passionate about. All non-CCS volunteer activities that are approved for regular school hours are automatically
                approved for ISP hours. That list can be found <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqIgeUuq654-jp21MVbcp59sP6dQh3QQC-7vUrMqcVE">here</a>. You can't complete your ISP
                with an activity that you used for a prior ISP, and you can't use hours from one activity for both your ISP and your
                graduation requirement hours. If you have any questions about what you can do for your ISP, please talk to Ms. Whisler
                or Ms. Haines, whose emails are listed <a class="link" href="contact">here.</a>

            <div class="answer">
                A. You must have a legitimate excuse that both Ms. Whisler and Ms. Haines have been notified about at least 24 hours
                before the meeting or event. If you fail to notify both advisors within the allotted time frame, it will be marked as
                an unexcused absence. Two missed events, including meetings, result in your receiving one demerit. After three
                demerits, you will be placed on probation and your membership will be reconsidered by the faculty council. If you find
                at any point that you are unable to attend a meeting or event, make sure to let us know as soon as possible!
