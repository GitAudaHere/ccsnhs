-> The dropdown menu div starts from above the menu text.
    This glitches out the animation. I think it is also because of this that
    the color change animation happens twice when you stay on the text.

-> When you hover over the menu text and wait for the animation to complete,
    you can't click on the dropdown items because the slideUp animation
    starts.
