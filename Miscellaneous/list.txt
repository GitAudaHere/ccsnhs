******| Problems |******

-> Formatting of the events section.
    [RESOLVED]

-> Simplify the code for the margins and spacing of elements.


******| Bugs |******

-> The dropdown menu div starts from above the menu text.
    This glitches out the animation. I think it is also because of this that
    the color change animation happens twice when you stay on the text.
    [RESOLVED]

-> When you hover over the menu text and don't wait for the animation to
    complete, you can't click on the dropdown items because the slideUp
    animation starts.
    [RESOLVED]

-> There is a slight delay between hovering over a dropdown element
    and the element changing color when the elements are highlighted in
    rapid succession.
    [RESOLVED]
