free to add more sections when
necessary.

******| To-Do List |******

-> Add pictures to the pages. (Need to get pictures from Yearbook (Abby?))
-> UPDATE: Springer's looking to leave CCS. He's going to be no help in getting us
    any photos. On top of this, there don't seem to be any photos of NHS events
    anywhere. Maybe we should have historian take photos of events for the website?

-> Add icons (Where?)
-> UPDATE: I still don't get what this means.

-> Format the bylaws into dropdown sections.

-> Add tutoring calendar to tutoring page.

-> Add news to society news div.

-> Add real meeting times to the upcoming meetings table.


******| Problems |******


******| Bugs |******

-> The dropdown sections in bylaws completely disappear when you try to collapse them.
    Need to figure out how to keep them there.
