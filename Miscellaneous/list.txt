================================
Make sure the formatting is the
same throughout this file. Feel
free to add more sections when
necessary.

******| TODO List |******

-> Reformat the headings (h1, h2, etc.) so that you don't have to change
    each one specifically.

-> Add title for the events page.

-> Add picture to the pages. (Need to get pictures from Yearbook (Abby?))

-> Add descriptions of officer roles.

-> Add a "back to top" button.

-> Add a footer (maybe a disclaimer?)

-> Add icons (Where?)

-> Add mission statement? (This should be in "About > Our Mission")

-> Add by-laws page? (By-laws should go in "Our Requirements")

-> Add tutoring page (This could go under "Resources" or something)


******| Problems |******

-> Formatting of the events section.


******| Bugs |******

-> The dropdown menu div starts from above the menu text.
    This glitches out the animation. I think it is also because of this that
    the color change animation happens twice when you stay on the text.
    [RESOLVED]

-> When you hover over the menu text and don't wait for the animation to
    complete, you can't click on the dropdown items because the slideUp
    animation starts.
    [RESOLVED]

-> There is a slight delay between hovering over a dropdown element
    and the element changing color when the elements are highlighted in
    rapid succession.
