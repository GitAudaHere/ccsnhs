Q. How often should I check this website?
A. Fairly often; the website is updated frequently. If you missed a meeting, you can find
the notes about it in the meetings page afterwards. After certain events, the home page
will have new links to write-ups about those events. And it's always a good idea to keep
track of the meeting dates and times throughout the year. But don't worry if you forget to
check the website; we'll send you any important information in an email, just to make sure
you get it!

Q. What information can I find here?
A. This website has plenty to offer:
    - Society news
    - Meeting dates and times
    - Event dates and times
    - Information about the NHS
    - NHS bylaws
    - Meeting notes
    - NHS calendar
    - Important documents
    - Instructions for logging hours
    - Tutoring availability
    - Information to contact officers and advisors

*** I don't think this is a question that someone will ask ***
Q. Will this website work on my phone? 
A. Yes it will. In fact, you might be reading this on a mobile device right now!

Q. How can I join the NHS?
A. Each year, the NHS selects sophomore, junior, and senior students who display exemplary signs of scholarship,
character, leadership, and service â€“ the four pillars of the NHS. If you are in one of the aforementioned grades,
have been in attendance at Collegium for at least one semester, and have a cumulated weighted GPA of at least 93%,
than you are eligible for further consideration based on your character, leadership, and service. You will be asked
to fill out a "candidate information form" listing your leadership roles and service activities, and your teachers
will be interviewed to determine your character. If the faculty council decides that you meet the selection criteria,
then you get an invitation to our induction on November 15th, 2018, where we welcome you into our society!

Q. What if I can't get a ride to the morning meetings?
A. IF you find it difficult to attend the morning meetings, please come talk to one of the officers or a fellow member.
You can find a full list of members in the "Our Members" page, and contact one of the officers in the "Contact" page.
We'd be happy to help find someone to take you to our morning meetings. Fortunately, the meetings start at 7:10am this
year, a little later than the 7:00am start time that we had last year, and there are fewer meetings, so you won't need
to come as early or as often.

*** Are the file names going to be replaced? ***
Q. What kinds of activities can I do for volunteer hours?
A. You can get hours for attending any NHS service event that occurs before or after school hours. You can find a list
of events here. [events.html] All hours should be logged through x2VOL. [hours.html]. Baking does not count towards
NHS hours. Attending induction doesn't either; it's a mandatory event.

Q. What kinds of activities can I do for my ISP?
A. The goal of the Indepedent Service Project is to foster love and desire to serve the community in ways that you
are passionate about. All non-CCS volunteer activities that are approved for regular school hours are automatically
approved for ISP hours. That list can be found here. [List, which I have the link for.] You can't complete your ISP
with an activity that you used for a prior ISP, and you can't use hours from one activity for both your ISP and your
graduation requirement hours. If you have any questions about what you can do for your ISP, please talk to Ms. Whisler
or Ms. Haines, whose emails are listed here. [contact.html].

*** Do both advisers have to be notified? ***
Q. What do I do if I can't make it to a mandatory meeting or event?
A. You must have a legitimate excuse that both Ms. Whisler and Ms. Haines have been notified about at least 24 hours
before the meeting or event. If you fail to notify both advisors within the allotted time frame, it will be marked as
an unexcused absence. Two missed events, including meetings, result in your receiving one demerit. After three
demerits, you will be placed on probation and your membership will be reconsidered by the faculty council. If you find
at any point that you are unable to attend a meeting or event, make sure to let us know as soon as possible!
