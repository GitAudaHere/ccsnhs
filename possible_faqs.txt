Q. How often should I check this website?
A. Fairly often; the website is updated frequently. If you missed a meeting, you can find
the notes about it in the meetings page afterwards. After certain events, the home page
will have new links to write-ups about those events. And it's always a good idea to keep
track of the meeting dates and times throughout the year. But don't worry if you forget to
check the website; we'll send you any important information in an email, just to make sure
you get it!
